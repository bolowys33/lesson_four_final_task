                    <p>
                        If you want to be good at React, building projects is
                        one of the best ways to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have put together eight different projects that will
                        not only show you what's possible to make with React,
                        but give you some inspiration on what apps to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I will give you all the tools that you
                        need to effectively build out each project in the list.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's get started!</p>
                    <div class="todo-app">
                        <h1>Todo App</h1>
                        <p>
                            If you want to get started building projects,
                            there's no better starting place than a simple todo
                            app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A todo application will feature basic CRUD
                            functionality, meaning that you can create, read,
                            update and delete todos. Todos can be replaced with
                            whatever type of content that you want. In fact,
                            many applications we use on a daily basis could
                            arguably be considered glorified todo apps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The benefit of building a todo app is that the
                            entire app can be made in a short period of time. If
                            you can build a todo app without any tutorial to
                            guide you, it is a good test to see your proficiency
                            with React.
                        </p>
                        <div class="blog-image">
                            <img src="./images/todo.png" alt="tod0" />
                            <p class="label">TodoMVC todo app</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Todo apps are a great project to begin with because
                            you do not need any third-party libraries to build
                            them. You can make your todo app as complex as you
                            like, which will help you become confident with
                            concepts that you want to learn. Want to add
                            authentication or a database to your app? Feel free
                            to do so! You can truly make it as simple or complex
                            as you like.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A step up from the basic todo app is a blog website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you would like to write in <strong>Markdown</strong>, which is a
                            popular style of writing and formatting text, your
                            blog will likely consist of a number of Markdown
                            (.md) files.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want the content to be included locally
                            within the project to make it a bit more difficult,
                            you could try fetching it from an external source
                            like a CMS (content management system) such as
                            Sanity or Contentful.

                                (https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/)
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            In either case, this blog is going to consist of
                            static pages so you can use any static site
                            generator that you like.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good framework choice for this blog could be
                            <strong>Next.js</strong> or <strong>Gatsby</strong>. Both are ideal to make
                            text-driven websites like blogs because they are
                            server-rendered frameworks and give you better SEO.
                            This is compared to a traditional client-rendered
                            React app (one made with Create React App, for
                            example).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our stack will consist of one of these React
                            frameworks plus a transformer to convert our
                            markdown content into HTML when our site is built. A
                            good choice to transform our markdown content is the
                            <code>remark</code> npm package.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to make an even more impressive blog,
                            with dynamic content, then you can consider using
                            <strong>MDX</strong>. MDX is very similar to plain markdown, but it
                            also allows you to include your own custom React
                            components within the markdown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use MDX, you would use a package like
                            <code>next-mdx-remote</code> if you're using Next.js. The plain
                            <code>mdx-js/mdx</code> package also works great.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Next.js/Gatsby</li>
                            <li>
                                Markdown or MDX (<code>remark</code> or
                                <code>mdx-js/mdx</code>)
                            </li>
                            <li>CMS (Contentful or Sanity)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Just a quick note: for each of these projects, I
                            won't be talking about styling. I personally prefer
                            using plain CSS in the form of TailwindCSS. You can
                            head to Tailwind's website to see how to easily set
                            that up for whatever React framework you're using.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="e-commerce">
                        <h1>E-commerce App</h1>
                        <p>
                            The next step up from our blog project is an
                            e-commerce app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It has a lot of similar features to our blog,
                            including the fact that most of the content is going
                            to be largely static and unchanging.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once again, the data can be sourced locally or
                            fetched from a CMS at build time. What's different
                            about an e-commerce app is that it allows us to
                            venture into working with a server of some sort.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you want your customers to purchase an item
                            through Stripe, for example, you might want to set
                            up a webhook that will receive an event from Stripe
                            when your customer has purchased a particular item.
                            This is essential for managing things like your
                            product inventory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To very easily write server-side code, you could use
                            an API route so that you don't have to set up a
                            complete Node.js project. This function would
                            process different events that take place upon
                            checkout or after checkout.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, if you don't want to have to touch any
                            server-side code, you can avoid the <code>stripe</code> npm
                            package entirely and just use <strong>Stripe checkout</strong> or a
                            <strong>Stripe payment link.</strong>

                            Going forward, every project that we're going to
                            touch on will involve a server of some sort. Most
                            every application you use has a backend and a
                            frontend. React will always be the frontend of our
                            application but be aware that for any of these
                            projects, you can very easily set up a server for
                            your application to handle things like talking with
                            a database when you have a framework like Next.js.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next.js includes a special type of page called an
                            <strong>API route</strong>, which allows you to do server-side things
                            such as authentication, webhooks, reading and
                            writing to a database, and much more. Additionally,
                            we'll touch on some solutions like Firebase that
                            don't require you to make a backend at all!

                        <p>
                            A Reddit clone that is centered around sharing links
                            or very simple posts is a good step up from our todo
                            app.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            We are still creating, updating, and deleting data,
                            but this time it's going to be saved in a database.
                            We might allow users to add different types of
                            content, like a video or a link or a short post. We
                            can use Firebase for our project to get started,
                            which will give us the <strong>Firestore database.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our Firestore database will consist of a simple
                            collection that will save all of the individual
                            posts that a user has made. We can further develop
                            it by allowing other users to add comments and likes
                            to the posts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An even more developed app would include
                            authentication. Fortunately, <strong>Firebase Auth</strong> makes it
                            very easy. We can also add likes to individual
                            comments and replies to comments for our comment
                            threads.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We could use any React framework for this. A good
                            choice would be one using a <strong>Vite</strong> template. For our
                            individual posts, we would need dynamic routes to
                            fetch individual posts based off of their id. A good
                            choice for that would be React Router.

                        <p>
                            To add to our Reddit app, we could make it into
                            something like Discord by displaying messages in
                            realtime.
                        </p>
                        <div class="blog-image">
                            <img
                                src="./images/ezgif-4-bd75470d3f.gif"

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            If we change the posts into threads, we now have a
                            chat app where it's an ongoing conversation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like the Reddit clone, users can still add any type
                            of media that they like. A good touch would be
                            adding link previews so when a user shares a link,
                            such as a YouTube video, other users can get a
                            little card that displays what is actually linked to
                            with an image before the user clicks on it. There's
                            a library called <code>react-tiny-link</code> that allows you to
                            do that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can still use Firebase for this project. This is
                            a good use case for the Firebase realtime database
                            so that we don't need to refresh or reload the page
                            to see new messages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, we can add different roles to our
                            users in Discord. In the real Discord app, there are
                            moderators with greater controls over the other
                            users. One example feature would be to add a ban
                            feature to remove a user from a given channel or
                            community.

                        <h1>Messenger App (WhatsApp Clone)</h1>
                        <p>
                            An offshoot of this type of realtime app would be a
                            messenger-style app like that of WhatsApp.

                        <p>
                            This app would be a little bit more limited in that
                            conversations are usually done with one person,
                            although they don't have to be. Instead of talking
                            in channels you will have different options to talk
                            with one or another person at a time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good touch would be to add notifications when
                            someone messages you. This is another app example
                            that would require realtime data functionality from
                            your database. Firebase is always a good option for
                            that.

                        <p>
                            If Firebase gets boring, you could try Supabase
                            which is a very competitive alternative also with
                            realtime database features, but which is backed by
                            Postgres instead of Firestore.

                            What if instead of having an app where one person
                            talks directly with another person in a very
                            confined space, you want the opposite, where anyone
                            can interact with anyone!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A great example of this type of app would be

                        <p>
                            Twitter is an app that requires a feed as well as a
                            trending page in a user's feed. The user will be
                            able to see all of the posts from the people that
                            they follow. But on the trending page, they will see
                            all of the most popular posts across the entire
                            website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To be able to figure out which posts are the most
                            popular, you will add the ability to like (heart) a
                            given post as well as re-share it, which allows a
                            post to be added to or associated with another user.
                            Finally, you will want to allow users to directly
                            reply to other posts (like Twitter's "quote tweet"
                            feature).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And another fundamental feature that could be added
                            to every app that we've covered up until this point
                            is search. In our Twitter clone, users would likely
                            want to be able to search for different users to
                            follow as well as posts based on their content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One downside to Firebase is that it does not have
                            the best tools for search and it's not easy to
                            perform queries that are based on a certain keyword.
                            This is one instance in which <strong>Supabase</strong> would be a
                            superior alternative.

                            The two apps have very similar features, with
                            YouTube primarily focusing on long form video
                            content and Tiktok mainly consisting of super-short
                            videos under a minute.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both platforms utilize an infinite scroll feature,
                            whether you're scrolling through suggested videos or
                            recommended videos. TikTok itself is arguably just
                            one big infinite-scrolling feed.

                            What would be hardest to implement about both these
                            platforms is the algorithm. You could go very far on
                            building an app that just relies on users following
                            other users and having a homepage with the most
                            popular videos. Your users would first be suggested
                            videos from the people that they follow and then the
                            popular videos on the site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most essential feature for both TikTok and
                            YouTube is streaming video. To allow users to upload
                            their own content you need a service that includes
                            an upload API. Some good choices in this area are
                            <strong>Cloudflare Stream</strong>, Video.js, or Mux.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of these tools provide you with a video player
                            as well as an API, which would handle uploading
                            videos that could then be posted to the site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would personally build this app using my own
                            server and database. I would probably choose <strong>Prisma</strong>
                            as the ORM (object-relational mapped) to interact
                            with the database which would be a <strong>MySQL</strong> database
                            managed by Planetscale.
